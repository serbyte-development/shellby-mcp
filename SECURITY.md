# Security Policy

Shellby MCP intentionally gives authorized MCP callers powerful access to the local macOS user account. Treat authentication, tunnel policy, command execution, browser control, and file access issues as security-sensitive.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's **Report a vulnerability** flow for this repository. Do not open a public issue for an unpatched vulnerability or include credentials, tokens, private URLs, or personal data in a report.

Include the affected version or commit, reproduction steps, impact, and any suggested mitigation when available.

## Scope

The supported release target is macOS on Apple Silicon or Intel. Direct localhost MCP access is intentionally unauthenticated; the remote ChatGPT path depends on the checked-in ngrok trust policy plus Shellby MCP's bound OpenAI subject check. See the README and [`wiki/pages/http-transport.md`](wiki/pages/http-transport.md) for the current trust model.
