# Workspace Tooling

## What This Is

This page documents the configured coding workspace and dynamic skill catalog.

## Default Workspace

`MCP_CWD` feeds `MCP_CONFIG.workspace` and defaults to `~/Desktop/agent-workspace`. `src/config.ts` expands `~` and resolves relative paths from the startup directory; the resolved workspace becomes the initial shell cwd, advertised `AGENTS.md`, and workspace-relative tool root. `npm run setup` creates the workspace recursively, creates a starter `AGENTS.md` only when absent, and copies the repository's `create-skill` starter into `<workspace>/skills/create-skill/SKILL.md` only when absent. Re-running setup preserves customized copies of both files. Managed `npm start` requires the workspace to already exist and directs missing-workspace callers to run setup; `src/index.ts` assumes that bootstrap has already happened. This is a convention, not a sandbox (`src/config.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `scripts/setup.mjs`, `scripts/start.mjs`, `scripts/workspace-setup.mjs`, `skills/create-skill/SKILL.md`, `test/setup-workspace.test.ts`).

## Workspace Skills

Reusable agent workflows live under `<workspace>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. `skill_list` scans that directory on every call and returns the directory name plus frontmatter description when present; `skill_load` validates one returned name and returns its complete instructions plus local `SKILL.md` path. Skills are therefore dynamic data rather than MCP schema entries, so adding or removing a skill does not require rebuilding the server (`src/tools/skills.ts`, `src/server/mcp-server.ts`).

The maintainer workspace catalog is intentionally not enumerated here because it is dynamic and can change without a Shellby rebuild. Directory symlinks are supported, so selected shared skills can stay single-sourced while still appearing under `<workspace>/skills` (`src/tools/skills.ts`, `test/skills.test.ts`).

Skill names accept only alphanumeric-leading names containing letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens, preventing path traversal while still allowing a named workspace entry to be a symlink. `SKILL.md` is capped at 256 KiB; broken or oversized entries are omitted from `skill_list`, while direct `skill_load` calls return explicit errors (`src/tools/skills.ts`).

## Skill Bootstrap Boundary

`skills/create-skill/SKILL.md` is repository-owned bootstrap source, while `<workspace>/skills/create-skill/SKILL.md` becomes workspace-owned state after the first setup copy. Runtime discovery scans only `<workspace>/skills`; repository-level skill files do not enter `skill_list` or `skill_load` unless setup or another explicit mechanism places them there (`scripts/workspace-setup.mjs`, `skills/create-skill/SKILL.md`, `src/tools/skills.ts`).
