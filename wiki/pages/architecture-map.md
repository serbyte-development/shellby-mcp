# Architecture Map

## What This Is

This page maps the process-level components and follows one request from the HTTP boundary into shared runtime state and capability handlers.

## Request Lifecycle

1. `src/index.ts` parses configuration, prepares durable/process-level state, and composes shared runtime services (`src/index.ts`, `src/config.ts`).
2. `src/server/http-server.ts` accepts an MCP request, applies the transport/ownership boundary, and creates a short-lived MCP server/transport around shared process services. See [HTTP Transport](./http-transport.md).
3. `src/server/mcp-server.ts` registers the model-facing tools; the selected capability module under `src/tools/` owns its schema, handler, result, and domain errors.
4. Stateful capabilities retain only their intended boundary: named shells and webpage documents are process-local; Computer Use capture targets are process-local; subagent turn state is process-local while conversation URL + turn count persist best-effort in `~/.shellby/subagents.sqlite`. Dedicated pages document those lifecycles.
