# Wiki Context Log

Record only durable historical context that cannot be cheaply reconstructed from commit messages, diffs, the current repository/wiki, or preserved raw evidence. Most changes do not need an entry.

## 2026-08-04 — Static bearer authentication was tried and removed

Shellby briefly required a shared `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, then removed it after confirming the ChatGPT connector path did not fit a fixed custom bearer-token model. Remote ownership later converged on the ngrok origin boundary plus bound OpenAI subject metadata. Do not treat the removed shared-secret design as an unfinished requirement.

## 2026-08-07 — Browser-backed subagents established important UI constraints

Live validation showed that normal background Chrome works while headless Chrome encountered a Cloudflare challenge. Direct contenteditable filling also duplicated prompt text; page-targeted keyboard insertion followed by ChatGPT's Send action avoided that failure. The current browser submission path reflects those findings.

## 2026-08-15 — Direct conversation recovery fetch was abandoned

An authenticated page-context request to `/backend-api/conversation/<conversation_id>` returned `conversation_inaccessible`, so that direct-fetch recovery approach was dropped. Recovery later converged on observed ChatGPT-owned traffic and ultimately raw-CDP turn tracking with bounded catastrophic recovery. Avoid reintroducing the direct page-context fetch without fresh evidence that the private endpoint behavior changed.

## 2026-09-12 — Config upgrades preserve existing operator choices

Making a newly exposed setting required broke existing configurations. Public settings now resolve omitted defaults at load time and recover invalid values individually, so adding an option does not require a file migration. Setup leaves existing files intact to preserve comments and alternate TOML layouts. Whole-file fallback for malformed syntax was deliberately excluded: it could silently discard disabled tool groups or a reserved tunnel URL. Runtime, scaffold defaults, and PM2/ngrok must share the same interpretation.

## 2026-09-12 — Routine restart retains PM2; macOS recovery is explicit

Recreating PM2 on every restart broke restarts requested through Shellby's own shells: shutting down the daemon also killed the CLI responsible for bringing services back. The full reset was introduced for stale macOS permission/service context, which routine app reloads cannot repair. Keep routine restart inside the surviving PM2 daemon and reserve daemon recreation for `restart -- --hard` from a healthy external Terminal session. A disposable PM2 daemon confirmed that app reload completes after its requesting CLI is killed. The initiating tool call may disconnect; preserving that call does not justify detached workers or changes to tool behavior.

## 2026-09-13 — State directory is intended for simultaneous repository copies

The operator clarified that `state_dir` exists so a copied repository can run as a separate MCP alongside the original. Storage separation alone did not meet that intent: MCP, ngrok's local API, and Chrome also need separate ports, and independent remote connectors need distinct public endpoints. Keep lifecycle commands scoped to the configured PM2 home and prevent health checks or URL discovery from accepting the other copy. Local-only copies can disable ngrok entirely.

## 2026-09-22 — Subagent failures preserve the caller abstraction

A real `BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE` response caused the calling agent to rewrite the delegated prompt around Chrome even though the prompt was unrelated to the infrastructure failure. Caller-facing subagent errors now hide browser, authentication, and UI implementation details and return recovery guidance at the subagent-service level. Keep backend-specific diagnostics internal so callers respond to delegation availability instead of attempting to repair the hidden transport through prompt changes.

## 2026-09-23 — Freshness fingerprints require correct knowledge ownership

A full wiki audit found stale shell limits on a page still marked current: its paths omitted the configuration/scheduler owners. Copied limits and repeated subsystem summaries amplified drift. Keep changeable values in source, give durable semantics one owning page, and use fingerprints as review prompts rather than correctness certificates. Preserve historical probes as dated evidence; they cannot establish current private-client behavior.
